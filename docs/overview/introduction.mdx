## What is Voicebox?

Voicebox is a **local-first voice cloning studio** with DAW-like features for professional voice synthesis. Think of it as a **local, free and open-source alternative to ElevenLabs** — download models, clone voices, and generate speech entirely on your machine.

Unlike cloud services that lock your voice data behind subscriptions, Voicebox gives you:

- **Complete privacy** — models and voice data stay on your machine
- **Professional tools** — multi-track timeline editor, audio trimming, conversation mixing
- **Model flexibility** — currently powered by Qwen3-TTS, with support for XTTS, Bark, and other models coming soon
- **API-first** — use the desktop app or integrate voice synthesis into your own projects
- **Native performance** — built with Tauri (Rust), not Electron

Download a voice model, clone any voice from a few seconds of audio, and compose multi-voice projects with studio-grade editing tools. No Python install required, no cloud dependency, no limits.
